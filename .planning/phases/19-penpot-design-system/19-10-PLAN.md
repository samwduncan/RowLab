<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create design specification annotations</name>
  <files>Penpot annotations (via MCP)</files>
  <action>
Add specification annotations to key designs in 05-Design-Specs/Component-Specs:

Spacing annotations:
- Add dimension callouts to landing page hero
- Document padding values (16px, 24px, 32px, etc.)
- Show margin between sections
- Grid gap specifications

Typography annotations:
- Label each text element with font style name
- Reference: "Display/Hero", "Body/Large", etc.
- Document line-height and letter-spacing

Color annotations:
- Label each color with token name
- Reference: "Ink/Deep", "Data/Good", etc.
- Note opacity values where applicable

Interactive behavior notes:
- Hover states: "bg transitions to Ink/Float"
- Click animations: "scale 0.98, 100ms"
- Scroll behaviors: "sticky header at 64px"
- Transitions: "150ms ease-out"

Animation specifications:
- Spring physics: "stiffness: 400, damping: 17"
- Fade-in: "opacity 0→1, 150ms"
- Slide-in: "translateY 24px→0, 150ms"

Responsive breakpoints:
- Desktop: 1440px+
- Tablet: 768px-1439px
- Mobile: <768px
- Note key layout changes at each breakpoint

Create measurement guide frame showing spacing scale:
- 4px, 8px, 12px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px
- With visual reference blocks
  </action>
  <verify>
Component-Specs frame contains annotated designs with measurements and behavior notes.
  </verify>
  <done>
Design specifications created with spacing, typography, color, and animation annotations.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Export design assets</name>
  <files>Exported files (via MCP export tools)</files>
  <action>
Export design assets using `mcp__penpot__export_shape`:

Logo exports:
- RowLab logo (if created): SVG and PNG @1x, @2x
- Export to 05-Design-Specs/Export-Assets/logos/

Icon exports (if custom icons created):
- Export any custom icons as SVG
- Ensure 24px default size
- Note: prefer Lucide icons over custom where possible

Component screenshots:
- Export key component variants as PNG for documentation
- Button states grid
- Card variants
- Form elements

Full page mockups:
- Landing page hero: PNG @1x for documentation
- Dashboard overview: PNG @1x
- Mobile layouts: PNG @1x

Asset manifest:
Create text annotation listing all exported assets:
- Filename, dimensions, format
- Usage notes
- Where to place in codebase

Note any assets that don't need export:
- Colors: use CSS variables from tailwind.config.js
- Typography: use Tailwind classes
- Icons: use Lucide (already in codebase)
  </action>
  <verify>
Export-Assets frame contains exported logos/icons/screenshots with manifest.
  </verify>
  <done>
Design assets exported with manifest documenting filenames and usage.

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 3: Stakeholder design review and approval</name>
  <what-built>
Complete Penpot design system including:
- Landing page designs (hero, features, gallery, CTA, footer)
- Application UI designs (dashboard, athletes, lineup builder)
- Component library (buttons, cards, forms, navigation)
- Design tokens (colors, typography)
- 19 rowing images integrated
- Design specifications with annotations
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Open Penpot project "RowLab Design System"
2. Review each page:
   - 01-Brand-Identity: Color palette matches Dark Editorial aesthetic
   - 02-Component-Library: Components are consistent and complete
   - 03-Landing-Page: Hero, features, gallery, CTA, footer designs
   - 04-App-UI-Dashboard: Dashboard, athletes, lineup builder designs
   - 05-Design-Specs: Annotations and exported assets

3. Evaluate against success criteria:
   - Does the visual direction feel like a "precision instrument"?
   - Is the Dark Editorial aesthetic (monochrome UI, chromatic data) maintained?
   - Are rowing images appropriately integrated?
   - Will developers be able to implement from these designs?

4. Provide feedback:
   - Approve as-is
   - Request specific changes (list items to revise)
   - Request additional designs (specify what's missing)
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>
Type "approved" to confirm visual direction, or describe requested changes.
  </resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- Design specs contain measurements, colors, typography annotations
- Assets exported with clear manifest
- Stakeholder has reviewed all design pages
- Approval or feedback documented
</verification>

<success_criteria>
1. All designs have specification annotations
2. Assets exported in correct formats (SVG for icons, PNG for screenshots)
3. Stakeholder confirms visual direction is correct
4. No major design revisions needed (or revision scope defined)
5. Designs ready for implementation reference
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion (including stakeholder approval), create:
- `.planning/phases/19-penpot-design-system/19-10-SUMMARY.md`
- `.planning/phases/19-penpot-design-system/19-DESIGN-APPROVAL.md` (record of approval/feedback)
</output>
