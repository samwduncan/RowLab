<objective>
Final verification checkpoint for the complete design overhaul.

Purpose: Ensure all design system changes work together harmoniously. This is the "would you show this to a friend" quality check. All components should feel polished, animations should be satisfying, and the app should look like a precision instrument.

Output: Verified design system or list of issues to address

  <what-built>Complete Phase 17 Design System Overhaul</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
### 1. Color System Verification

Start the dev server and navigate through the app:

**Dark Theme:**
1. Go to http://localhost:3001/app
2. Ensure theme is set to dark (Settings > Theme)
3. Verify:
   - Background is warm near-black (#0F0F0F), not cool gray
   - Text is warm off-white (#F5F5F4), not pure white
   - Borders have warm undertone (#292524)
   - Cards have subtle elevation with warm shadows

**Light Theme:**
1. Switch to light theme in Settings
2. Verify:
   - Background is warm white (#FAFAF9), not cool white
   - Text is warm near-black, not pure black
   - Same warmth as dark theme, just inverted

**Field Theme:**
1. Switch to field theme
2. Verify:
   - High contrast amber backgrounds visible
   - Dark text readable in bright conditions
   - Interactive elements have amber accent

### 2. Typography Verification

Navigate to any data-heavy page (Athletes, Erg Tests, Seat Racing):

1. Verify headings use Inter font (clean, modern)
2. Verify numeric data uses Geist Mono (tabular-nums)
3. Check alignment:
   - Numbers in tables should align vertically
   - Erg times should look like stroke coach display
4. Test metric display (if visible):
   - Large numbers (48-72px) should feel like precision instruments

### 3. Animation Verification

**Buttons:**
1. Click various buttons throughout the app
2. Verify 0.96 scale press feedback (subtle "press in" on tap)
3. Check hover states have subtle scale and shadow

**Cards:**
1. Hover over cards (Athletes, Lineups, etc.)
2. Verify subtle lift animation (scale 1.01, y: -2)
3. Check spring physics feel (not linear, natural settle)

**Modals:**
1. Open any modal (Add Athlete, New Lineup, etc.)
2. Verify smooth enter animation (scale + fade)
3. Close modal and verify exit animation

**Toggle Switches:**
1. Find toggle switches (Settings, Feature Toggles)
2. Verify spring physics on thumb movement
3. Check glow effect when enabled

### 4. Mobile Verification

Use browser DevTools to simulate mobile (375px width):

1. Verify bottom navigation appears
2. Check touch targets are at least 44px
3. Tables should transform to cards (if applicable)
4. Navigation items should be reachable with one hand
5. Safe area spacing at bottom (for notched devices)

### 5. Specific Components

**Inputs:**
1. Focus on input fields
2. Verify focus ring with warm blue color
3. Test error states (if form validation available)

**Tables:**
1. Navigate to any table view
2. Verify row hover states
3. Check header styling (uppercase, tracking)
4. Verify borders use warm stone colors

### 6. Overall Quality Check

**The "Friend Test":**
- Would you show this app to a friend to say "look how nice this feels"?
- Does it feel like a precision instrument, not a generic dashboard?
- Are animations satisfying but not distracting?
- Does the data feel like the hero?

### Issues to Look For:
- [ ] Cool gray colors that should be warm stone
- [ ] Animations that feel linear/mechanical instead of spring-like
- [ ] Touch targets smaller than 44px
- [ ] Typography that doesn't align (non-tabular numbers)
- [ ] Inconsistent borders or shadows
- [ ] Components that don't match the aesthetic
- [ ] Any CSS cascade issues (wrong colors in certain contexts)
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>
Type "approved" if all checks pass.

If issues found, describe them in format:
- [ISSUE] Description of problem
- [LOCATION] Where in the app
- [EXPECTED] What it should look like
- [ACTUAL] What it actually looks like

Issues will be addressed in a gap closure plan.
